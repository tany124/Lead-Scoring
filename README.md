Code on Lead scoring case study:


Problem statement:



This case study is based on an online education service provider X  that sells online courses to industry professionals where professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. 
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 
To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.
If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. 
Target conversion rate is around 80%.

Solution:


The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

Benefits:


Sales effort will now only be made towards the most potential leads and not wasting resources on every lead.
Conversion rate will improve.
Customer satisfaction will increase.
